	[sdf-outline] removed functionality to return signed distance 
	from a point to a line.

	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): the function no more returns
	  signed distance. previously if two contour have connected 
	  endpoints then the function may return positive as well as
	  negativew with equal distance for both the contour from
	  specific point if the direction of the contours is different,
	  then we can't decide  weather the the point is inside or outside
	  the shape's outline. so, now the function only return unsigned
	  distance and later we can decide the sign based  on the shortest
	  distance.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (solve_quadratic_quation): added function to
	  solve quadratic equations.

	[sdf-outline] added functionality to return signed distance 
	from a point to a line.

	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): the function now return signed
	  distance from a point to a line. The sign is positive if the
	  point lie inside the outline and negative otherwise.
	  also written a comment explaining the procedure to find the
	  shortest distance from a point to a quadratic bezier curve.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (sdf_vector_): added few more
	  functions for easily manipulating the `SDF_Vector'.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h, ChangeLog: changed `minimum distance'
	  to `shortest distance'.

	[sdf-outline] Added function to find the shortest distance 
	from a point to a line (unsigned).

	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (get_min_distance): added function
	  which determine the type of the contour and returns the
	  shortest distance from a point to the contour. And 
	  implemented shortest distance from a point to a line.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (sdf_vector_): added various functions
	  for easily manipulating the `SDF_Vector'.

	* sdfgen.c: Fixed indentations and spacing to match
	  FreeType's code style.

	[sdf-outline] Added function to decompose outline.

	Reduced all lines to 78 characters.

	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (SDF_Decompose_Outline): Added function 
	  which use `FT_Outline_Decompose' to decompose and store it 
	  in `SDF_Shape' struct. This will make iterating through the
	  outline easier.
	* sdfgen.c: Started using `FT_THROW' macro instead of return
	  `FT_Error'.

	[sdf-outline] Added more structures and helper functions.

	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Shape): Added new structure.
	* sdfgen.c: Added functions for initializing and deleting
	  the SDF_ structures.

	[sdf-outline] Added a few essintial private structures.

	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Vector, SDF_Contour): Added new structures.
	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Contour_Type): Added new enumeration.
