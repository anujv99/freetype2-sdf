	* sdfgen.h (Generate_SDF): added an `spread' parameter
	  which is used to specify the maximum distance value.
	  Any distance greater than it will be discarded.
	  Also, now the distance is calculaed from the center of
	  the pixel (previously is was being calculated from the
	  bottom left corner).

	[sdf-outline] renamed `contour' to `edge' since a contour
	is used to represent a complete connected shape of edges
	of different types.

2020-05-29  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf-outline] replaced all `float' by a typedef `SDF_DataType'

	* sdfgen.c (Generate_SDF): fixed a calculation error while
	  white resolving conflict between two endpoints.
	  Now if two curves are equidistant from a point we check if
	  thier endpoints are connected and then use the curve which
	  make higher orthogonality with the point to correctly determine
	  the sign of the point.

	[sdf-outline] finished the algorithm for generating signed
	distnce fields from `FT_Outline'.

	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): combined the output of the function
	  to a struct `SDF_Signed_Distance'.

2020-05-27  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf-outline] finished the algorithm which return shortest
	distance from a point to line and quadratic/cubic bezier curve.

	* sdfgen.c (solve_quintic_equation, solve_quartic_equation):
	  removed becuase no longer using.
	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): changed the process for calculating
	  shortest distance from a point to a cubic bezier.
	  At first the process was to calculate the roots of a 5th degree
	  polynomial, but it was rather slow and did not yeild proper
	  results.
	  So, now the function first assumes the point which is nearest
	  to the cubci curve and then improve is using Newton-Raphson's
	  method.
	  The function is now complete and return shortest distance as
	  well as the direction at the nearest from all three curves.

	* sdfgen.c (solve_quintic_equation): finished the algorithm to
	  compute roots of a 5th degree polynomial equation. First the
	  ranges in which the roots lie are calculated using isolator
	  polynomials and then Newton-Raphson's method is used to find
	  the approximate roots within the  ranges.
	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): the function now return direction
	  of the quadratic bezier at the shortest point ( previously only
	  returned for lines ).

2020-05-24  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): added comment explaining the 
	  entire procedure of calculating shortest distance from a 
	  point to a cubic bezier curve.
	* sdfgen.c (solve_quartic_equation): added function to solve
	  a 4th degree polynomial equation.
	* sdfgen.c (solve_quintic_equation): added function to solve
	  a 5th degree polynomial equation. This is not complete yet.
	  For now it only compute the range in which the roots lie.

2020-05-20  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): fixed a calculation mistake for
	  calculating shortest distance from a point to quadratic bezier
	  curve. Instead of `c = B.B + A.p0 - A.p' the correct one will
	  be `c = 2B.B + A.p0 - A.p'. Now the function works correctly.
	  Also, the function now along with point on the curve return the
	  direction of the curve at that point.

2020-05-19  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf-outline] added algorithm to return find distance from
	a point to a quadratic/conic bezier curve.

	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): the function instead of the shortest
	  distance value int `float', now returns the point int vector form
	  on the curve which is at the least distance from a given point.
	  Also the function now return shortest distance vector from a point
	  to a quadratic bezier curve.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (solve_cubic_quation): added function to solve
	  cubic equations.

2020-05-18  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>
	
	[sdf-outline] removed functionality to return signed distance 
	from a point to a line.

	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): the function no more returns
	  signed distance. previously if two contour have connected 
	  endpoints then the function may return positive as well as
	  negative with equal distance for both the contour from
	  specific point if the direction of the contours is different,
	  then we can't decide  weather the the point is inside or outside
	  the shape's outline. so, now the function only return unsigned
	  distance and later we can decide the sign based  on the shortest
	  distance.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (solve_quadratic_quation): added function to
	  solve quadratic equations.

2020-05-17  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>
	
	[sdf-outline] added functionality to return signed distance 
	from a point to a line.

	* sdfgen.c (get_min_distance): the function now return signed
	  distance from a point to a line. The sign is positive if the
	  point lie inside the outline and negative otherwise.
	  also written a comment explaining the procedure to find the
	  shortest distance from a point to a quadratic bezier curve.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (sdf_vector_): added few more
	  functions for easily manipulating the `SDF_Vector'.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h, ChangeLog: changed `minimum distance'
	  to `shortest distance'.

2020-05-16  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf-outline] Added function to find the shortest distance 
	from a point to a line (unsigned).

	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (get_min_distance): added function
	  which determine the type of the contour and returns the
	  shortest distance from a point to the contour. And 
	  implemented shortest distance from a point to a line.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (sdf_vector_): added various functions
	  for easily manipulating the `SDF_Vector'.

2020-05-15  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>
	
	* sdfgen.c: Fixed indentations and spacing to match
	  FreeType's code style.

2020-05-15  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf-outline] Added function to decompose outline.

	Reduced all lines to 78 characters.

	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (SDF_Decompose_Outline): Added function 
	  which use `FT_Outline_Decompose' to decompose and store it 
	  in `SDF_Shape' struct. This will make iterating through the
	  outline easier.
	* sdfgen.c: Started using `FT_THROW' macro instead of return
	  `FT_Error'.

2020-05-14  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf-outline] Added more structures and helper functions.

	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Shape): Added new structure.
	* sdfgen.c: Added functions for initializing and deleting
	  the SDF_ structures.

2020-05-14  Anuj Verma  <anujv@iitbhilai.ac.in>

	[sdf-outline] Added a few essintial private structures.

	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Vector, SDF_Contour): Added new structures.
	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Contour_Type): Added new enumeration.
