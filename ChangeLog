	[sdf-outline] Added function to find the minimum distance 
	from a point to a line (unsigned).

	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (get_min_distance): added function
	  which determine the type of the contour and returns the
	  minimum distance from a point to the contour. And 
	  implemented minimum distance from a point to a line.
	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (sdf_vector_): added various functions
	  for easily manipulating the `SDF_Vector'.

	* sdfgen.c: Fixed indentations and spacing to match
	  FreeType's code style.

	[sdf-outline] Added function to decompose outline.

	Reduced all lines to 78 characters.

	* sdfgen.c, sdfgen.h (SDF_Decompose_Outline): Added function 
	  which use `FT_Outline_Decompose' to decompose and store it 
	  in `SDF_Shape' struct. This will make iterating through the
	  outline easier.
	* sdfgen.c: Started using `FT_THROW' macro instead of return
	  `FT_Error'.

	[sdf-outline] Added more structures and helper functions.

	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Shape): Added new structure.
	* sdfgen.c: Added functions for initializing and deleting
	  the SDF_ structures.

	[sdf-outline] Added a few essintial private structures.

	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Vector, SDF_Contour): Added new structures.
	* sdfgen.h (SDF_Contour_Type): Added new enumeration.
